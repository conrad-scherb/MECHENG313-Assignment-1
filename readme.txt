Task1.c - Implements the basic traffic light which alternates from red, yellow, green and repeats.
Task2.c - Implements a configurable traffic light, where the period between changing the LEDs by pressing a button
          to enter configuration mode and changing the period via ADC input potentiometer.
Task3.c - Implements a speed monitor system modelled by the pressing of two buttons. It calculates the speed of the car
          from the speed between button presses and outputs this as a PWM signal with a duty cycle proportional to speed.
Task4.c - Implements a red light camera that is triggered by a tactile push button. The red-light camera only occurs 
          if the push button is pressed during a red light. It counts the number of red-light cars and outputs this as a 
          PWM signal with a duty cycle proportional to the number of cars running red lights.
